A Flutter TODO app that allows users to store task data both in the cloud and locally. Tasky offers features such as task priority setting, task progress tracking, and supports Clean Architecture principles with GetIt for dependency injection.

## Features

- Local and cloud task storage
- Task priorities: Low, Medium, High
- Task progress tracking: Waiting, In Progress, Finished
- Built using clean architecture with separation of concerns

- ## Architecture

Tasky is built using **Clean Architecture**, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The project is divided into distinct layers:

1. **Domain Layer**: This contains the business logic and core entities. It is independent of external libraries and frameworks, making it highly reusable and testable.
   
2. **Data Layer**: This handles the appâ€™s data sources. It interacts with external APIs, databases (local and cloud), and repositories. The repository pattern is used to abstract and decouple data sources from the rest of the app.

3. **Presentation Layer**: This is where the user interface (UI) and user interaction logic live. The **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern is used for state management, ensuring a clear separation between business logic and UI code. 

4. **Dependency Injection**: The app uses **GetIt** for dependency injection. All the dependencies are registered at the start of the app, ensuring loose coupling between classes.

## Features

Tasky offers several core features:

- **Task Creation and Editing**: Users can create new tasks and edit existing ones.
  
- **Task Priorities**: Tasks can be assigned one of three prioritiesâ€”Low, Medium, or Highâ€”allowing users to manage their task urgency.

- **Task Progress Tracking**: Track the status of tasks with progress states: Waiting, In Progress, or Finished.
  
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are stored both locally using SQLite (via **sqflite**) and in the cloud, enabling data persistence across sessions and devices.

## How to Run Tests

This project comes with unit and widget tests to ensure correctness.

1. To run the tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```
2. Ensure that you have set up the environment correctly before running the tests. For testing JSON serialization or database interactions, you may need mock data or services.
